Hi, to work our code simply run from the command line and pass in a sentence as an argument. This will
be automatically generated to hexadecimal for you and passed into our encoder. You will be able to see 
the output of the phrase numbers and then that the decoder matches the original encoded hex message.

We attempted bit packing however ran out of time. We have included the LZWpack.java class for you to 
have a look at how we started if you are interested. 

Cheers,

Brogan and George :)
